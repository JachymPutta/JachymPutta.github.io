      <p> It's really one of the best things ever until you need something that is not packaged with Nix and is not
        easily package-able, then it's a pain. </p>
      <p> The upside is clear, especially for developers that often have to work on remote machines and benefit from
        having identical setups. It's also amazing when using software that's packaged with Nixâ€”a quick per-project
        <code>flake.nix</code> and everything is pretty much guaranteed to run smoothly. </p>
      <p> The problem is as soon as you need something that's not packaged with Nix. Despite <code>nixpkgs</code> being
        one of the richest package repositories out there, depending on what you're doing, this sadly happens
        semi-regularly. </p>
      <p> At that point, you really have two options: </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li><strong>Package it yourself</strong>, which is often much easier said than done, but not impossible.</li>
        <li><strong>Get rid of Nix completely</strong> for that particular setup, because getting Nix to play nice with
          non-Nix packages is a huge pain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Overall, it's probably worth it? Or maybe I've just sunk too much time into it to admit that it's not. Who
        knows? </p>
